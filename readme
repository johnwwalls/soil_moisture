Files to get data:

download_smap.py - downloads an h5 SMAP file for a given date covering the world. 
download_modis.py - downloads 6 hdf MODIS files for a givne date which together cover Oklahoma and Illinois
process_modis.py - merges the 6 MODIS files, warps them to the EPSG:4326 GPS coodinate system, cuts them to cover only
    the given state, then resamples them to be ~9km resolution. Does this for night and day, LST and QC, Illinois and Oklahoma
process_smap.py - the SMAP file is already in the correct coordinate system, but it's not set. So crop the SMAP data to cover the state 
    and then add the geotransform to the file(doesn't change any of the data)
get_date.py - calls the above functions, then merges all 8 generated files for each date and state into one 8 layer tif. This lines up all the pixels and makes
    future pixel-by-pixel analysis easier
merge_land_cover.py - merges the correct land cover tif file with the files generated in get_date.py
